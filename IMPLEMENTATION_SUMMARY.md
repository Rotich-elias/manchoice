# Implementation Summary - Loan-Products Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated product-based loans with automatic stock management across both backend (Laravel) and frontend (Flutter).

---

## Backend Changes (Laravel)

### Database
- ✅ Created `loan_items` table (links loans ↔ products)
- ✅ Foreign key constraints with cascade/restrict
- ✅ Automatic subtotal calculation

### Models
- ✅ `LoanItem` model with relationships
- ✅ `Loan` model: added `items()` relationship
- ✅ `Product` model: already had stock management methods

### API Endpoints
- ✅ `POST /api/loans` - Now accepts "items" array
- ✅ `POST /api/loans/{id}/approve` - Validates & deducts stock
- ✅ `GET /api/loans` - Returns loans with products
- ✅ `GET /api/products/categories` - Returns available categories

### Business Logic
- ✅ Stock validation before approval
- ✅ Automatic stock deduction on approval
- ✅ Insufficient stock blocking
- ✅ Unit prices locked at loan creation
- ✅ Products in use cannot be deleted

---

## Testing Checklist

### Backend
- [x] Create loan with products
- [x] Approve loan (stock deduction)
- [x] Block approval for insufficient stock
- [x] View loan with products
- [x] Get categories list

### Flutter
- [ ] Navigate to product selection
- [ ] Filter by category
- [ ] Search products
- [ ] Select products and quantities
- [ ] View running total
- [ ] Submit loan with products
- [ ] View loan details with products

---

## Key Points

1. **Products are optional** - Can create loans without products
2. **Stock deducted on approval** - Not on loan creation
3. **Historical pricing** - Prices locked at loan creation time
4. **Stock validation** - Prevents approval if insufficient stock
5. **Product deletion blocked** - Cannot delete products in active loans

---

## Next Steps

1. Test the product selection flow
2. Test loan creation with products
3. Test loan approval (stock deduction)
4. Verify insufficient stock handling
5. Test category filtering
6. Test product search
7. Verify image loading
8. Test on different devices
